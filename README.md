- Cotton is a vital cash crop, but diseases such as Aphids, Bacterial Blight, Target Spot, Army Worm, and Powdery Mildew significantly impact yield, causing losses ranging from 10% to 70%. Traditional manual disease detection methods are time-consuming, costly, and inefficient. This paper presents a CNN-based agricultural rover designed for real-time cotton leaf disease detection and targeted pesticide spraying. The system employs an ESP32 CAM module for image capture, deep learning techniques for disease classification, and an automated spraying mechanism for precise pesticide application. By integrating IoT-based monitoring and real-time decision-making, this approach enhances agricultural productivity, minimizes resource wastage, and supports sustainable farming practices. The proposed solution provides farmers with an efficient, scalable, and cost-effective alternative to conventional disease management strategies.
